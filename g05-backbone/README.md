# APPE - Backbone Stack

## Contents
* **bus**: RabbitMQ as messaging system. Our microservices communicate over this bus. Username: **appe** / password: **appe** 
* **portainer**: A web-based tool to monitor all your docker artefacts such as containers, networksâ€¦.
* **mongodb**: A nosql database to store data. No actively used, just for your convenience.
* **mongo-viewer**: A webbased DBMS for the mongo-db to view and modify the database content.

Additionally, there are some demo services in this stack. They comumnicate with each other over the bus and demonstrate the basic usage. These demo services can be removed.

## Usage - local development
Start the services using docker-compose:

   ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up```
   
Ensure all services (containers) are running:
   
   ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps -a```

Display the logs of all services:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f```

...or of a single service:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f bus```

## Accessing the endpoints - local development
The services run in virtual networks, but their endpoints are mapped to the host network using port mapping:

```bash
bus:
  ports:
    - "8082:15672"
```

The web interface of RabbitMQ (bus) runs on port **15672** in the virtual network. The endpoint is mapped to port **8082** in the host network. Hence, it can be accessed on this URL:

```http://localhost:8082```
